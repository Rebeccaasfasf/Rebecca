  <h2>Gold Market Strategy Notes: Balancing Order Flow and Macro Context</h2>
  <div class="post-meta">2025-09-09 · <strong>Trading</strong></div>
  <p>This week’s gold market displayed unusual volatility, with sharp intraday swings between 1945–1970. The challenge was not identifying direction, but managing risk and entries in an environment of liquidity gaps.</p>
  <details><summary>Read more</summary>
    <p>My approach combined <strong>heatmap signals</strong> with <strong>funding-rate checks</strong> to filter out false breakouts. The key insight was that resistance around 1965 remained intact until NY session overlap confirmed a structural shift.</p>
    <p>Macro context also played a role: U.S. CPI data hinted at sticky inflation, yet the dollar failed to rally, suggesting gold strength was hedge-driven. The conclusion: short-term patience, long-term conviction.</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Scale only when order flow and macro align.</p>

  <h2>Real Estate Insights: Coastal Villas in Brittany</h2>
  <div class="post-meta">2025-09-01 · <strong>Real Estate</strong></div>
  <p>Coastal villas in Brittany continue to attract both lifestyle buyers and international investors. The unique mix of culture, accessibility, and oceanfront views is creating a resilient niche market even as broader housing slows down.</p>
  <details><summary>Read more</summary>
    <p>Well-renovated villas command premium pricing; neglected properties offer value-add opportunities. Yield on rentals remains modest (3–4%) but is offset by capital appreciation and lifestyle benefits.</p>
    <p>Supply is tight—families hold for generations. Off-market deals represent the best opportunities for agile buyers.</p>
    <p><strong>Next:</strong> Expand search into Harhoura and Ibiza to diversify Atlantic & Mediterranean exposure.</p>

  <h2>Factory Expansion: Scaling Perfume Raw Materials for EU Markets</h2>
  <div class="post-meta">2025-08-20 · <strong>Factory</strong></div>
  <p>The factory is at a turning point: demand from two fragrance houses now exceeds baseline capacity. Scaling means not just more output, but better <em>consistency, sustainability, and compliance</em>.</p>
  <details><summary>Read more</summary>
    <p>Two sourcing partnerships secure lavender, rose, and oakmoss supply. CO₂ extraction is being integrated for higher purity with lower environmental impact.</p>
    <p>We’re preparing for the next EU audit with traceability and energy reports. Solar-assisted distillation and digital QC logs are underway.</p>
